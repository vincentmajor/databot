  "body": "# databot\r\nA *very* simple slack-based bot that listens to conversations that contain the word 'data'. \r\n\r\nCreated in Node.js using a [botkit](https://howdy.ai/botkit/) template from [Beep Boop](https://beepboophq.com).\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nWhen databot is invited to a channel, it will ambiently listen until it hears case-insensitive 'data'. It does not need to be bound by whitespace so 'database' and 'dataset' will trigger action. databot's only response is \r\n\r\nDid someone say **data**?\r\n\r\n![databot example](https://github.com/vincentmajor/databot/blob/master/resources/example.png)\r\n\r\n### Run in Beep Boop\r\nThis repository is connected to Beep Boop so any commits here will automatically deploy to my team.\r\n\r\n## Creating your own\r\n### Build a slack bot without Beep Boop or botkit\r\nFollow this [great tutorial](https://www.samdlc.com/a-super-simple-slack-bot-example/) to learn the basics of a locally hosted bot in Node.js.\r\n\r\n### Hosting on Beep Boop\r\nBeep Boop is a great, free (for up to three bots) service for hosting bots for slack. I recommend.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\nSee the [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) file (MIT).",
